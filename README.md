# Inventory
Ionic Inventory App

<h3> What's the features? </h3>
Idk man.. Just take a look by 
<ul>
<li> clone repo </li>
<li> run "npm install" inside the project folder</li>
<li> run "ionic serve" </li>
<li> Done </li>
</ul>

There's some bug that I have no time to deal with it. Actually simple bug. <br>
